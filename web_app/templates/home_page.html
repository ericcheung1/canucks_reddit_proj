            What this is and why I built it: 
        </h2>
        <p>
            This app analyzes post-game threads from the r/canucks subreddit to understand how fans react after each game. It currently uses two 
            different sentiment analysis models to classify the sentiment of each comment, as well as the overall tone of each thread.
            The All Posts page contains 62 post-game threads from the 2024–25 season, each with its own sentiment breakdown. Every comment is displayed alongside 
            its sentiment classification, giving a picture of how fans responded after each game.

            I became invested in the Vancouver Canucks again during the 2023–24 season after their strong start to the regular season and have been 
            following them since. Having lived in BC all my life, I never fully got into the team after what happened in 2011. But ever since two 
            easons ago, I’ve made it a habit to catch every game on TV if I can and became a frequent visitor of the r/canucks fan subreddit.
            Since the team was doing so well in the 2023–24 season, I noticed that many comments and posts were positive. But starting with the 
            2024–25 season and continuing throughout, I began to notice a trend of negative comments and posts on the subreddit. So I thought there was 
            potential to combine my data science skills and Canucks fandom to create this project.

        <h2>Sentiment Analysis Models Used:</h2>
        <ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>VADER</strong> (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a sentiment analysis tool designed for short, 
                    informal text like social media posts or reviews. It is part of <strong>NLTK</strong> (Natural Language Toolkit), a popular 
                    Python library for natural language processing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    VADER is <em>rule-based</em>, meaning it uses a predefined set of lexical rules and a sentiment dictionary—rather than machine learning—to 
                    evaluate text. It accounts for punctuation, capitalization, degree modifiers (e.g., "very"), and negations. For each text, it returns four 
                    scores: <strong>positive</strong>, <strong>neutral</strong>, and <strong>negative</strong> (indicating the proportion of sentiment in each direction), 
                    and a <strong>compound score</strong> from -1 to +1 summarizing overall sentiment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sentiment classification is based on the compound score using these standard thresholds:
                </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Compound ≥ 0.05</strong>: Positive</li>
                        <li><strong>Compound ≤ -0.05</strong>: Negative</li>
                        <li><strong>Between -0.05 and 0.05</strong>: Neutral</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
